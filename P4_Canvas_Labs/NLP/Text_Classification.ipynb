    "As we can see from the output above, the average vectorized article contains 107 non-zero columns. This means that 99.7% of each vector is actually zeroes! This is one reason why it's best not to create your own vectorizers, and rely on professional packages such as scikit-learn and NLTK instead -- they contain many speed and memory optimizations specifically for dealing with sparse vectors. This way, we aren't wasting a giant chunk of memory on a vectorized dataset that only has valid information in 0.3% of it. \n",
